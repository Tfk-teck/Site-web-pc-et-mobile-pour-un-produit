### What I learned
I have some basics in web dev, but this challenge was a good opportunity to practice and bring my knowledge to reality. What was difficult is to adjust the size of an image ðŸ–¼ so that it perfectly matches a specific area. I also learned how to use CSS Grid, this is my first opportunity to apply it.
